Project Summary: Digital Book Club Platform
Project Idea
The project is a digital book club platform that enables users to create, join, and manage online book clubs. It supports community interaction, collaborative reading, book suggestion and voting, scheduled reading sessions, and discussion forumsâ€”all in one centralized web and mobile-friendly platform.

Background and Purpose
In an increasingly digital world, traditional book clubs are losing traction due to geographical and scheduling limitations. There is a growing demand for virtual platforms that allow readers to stay connected, read together, and share thoughts asynchronously or in real-time. This project aims to bridge that gap by creating a scalable and user-friendly platform tailored for both casual readers and organized reading communities.

Vision and Goal
Vision:
To create a global digital space that fosters inclusive and engaging reading communities where members can discover, read, and discuss books together regardless of physical location.

Goal:
Develop a platform with intuitive user experience, strong social features, and essential book club management tools that make it easy for anyone to start or join a club and stay engaged with reading.

Problem Statement
There is no single, user-friendly, all-in-one platform that fully supports the social, organizational, and reading needs of modern book clubs. Readers often rely on fragmented tools like group chats, spreadsheets, and social media, which leads to poor engagement, disorganization, and drop-off in participation.

Allow users to create, join, and manage book clubs

Enable book suggestions and voting to foster democratic book selection
